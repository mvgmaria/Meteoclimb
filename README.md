Meteoclimb is a tool designed for climbers in Spain to help them find climbing spots (crags) for their upcoming trips while also providing weather forecasts for these areas.

Features
- Find Crags by Region – Choose one or multiple regions in Spain where you want to climb.
- Set Travel Preferences – Filter crags based on maximum driving time and/or distance in kilometers.
- Weather Forecasts – Get detailed weather predictions for your selected crags in 3-hour increments.
- Plan Ahead – View forecasts for up to 5 days (to ensure accuracy).

Current Development
- The core functionality is already working in Python. I am currently developing the front-end to enhance user experience.
